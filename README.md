# ScheduleNet
A tool for scheduling events written in .Net 

## Goal of this project
Allow an easy and efficient way to schedule events with other parties by removing the communication layer between them.
Users will be able to create an event in the app and optionally automatically notify each involved party by email with a direct unique link to the event.
The receiving user will be able to select or request specific dates that are available to them, then the creator will be able to confirm or select the dates that work for them.
This will alleviate the need for 1 on 1 confirmation between working dates by letting the system handle communication for involved parties.
